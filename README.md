#KDE Presentations

##Installation
Download plugin.media.kde.presentations.zip from the repository and install using Kodi's add-on manager. 

Alternatively, you can install it manually by following these instructions:  
Clone or download the contents of this repository to the [`<KODI_USERDATA>`](http://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata)`/addons` folder (where these files must be in a `plugin.media.kde.presentations` folder) and restart Kodi. 
The add-on `KDE Presentations` should now be available as both a Music Add-on and a Video Add-on in `Settings > Add-ons > My Add-ons` where you'll need to enable one of them (since it is a single add-on, this will automatically enable it for all categories). You can now access it from the Video Add-ons or Music Add-ons section of each library. 

##Usage
The add-on simply shows what's available on `https://files.kde.org` in the folders `akademy`, `confkdein` and `randa`. The video's will be displayed in the video add-on and the audio will be displayed in the audio add-on. 
Note that since `.ogg` files are currently considered audio files, some of the older video presentations in `.ogg` files are only shown in the Music library where they are played as audio.

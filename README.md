# KDE Presentations

## Installation
* Download [`plugin.media.kde.presentations.zip`](/raw/master/plugin.media.kde.presentations.zip) from this repository
* [Install](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file) using Kodi's add-on manager. 
* You can now access it from the Video Add-ons or Music Add-ons section of each library to access video or audio files respectively.

Alternatively, you can install it manually by following these instructions:  
* Clone or download the contents of this repository to the [`<KODI_USERDATA>`](http://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata)`/addons` folder (these files must be in a folder named `plugin.media.kde.presentations`) and restart Kodi. 
* Go to `Settings > Add-ons > My Add-ons` and enable the add-on `KDE Presentations` from either the Music Add-on or Video-addon category (since it is the same add-on, this will automatically enable both the Music and Video add-on).
* You can now access it from the Video Add-ons or Music Add-ons section of each library to access video or audio files respectively.

## Usage
The add-on simply shows what's available on `https://files.kde.org` in the folders `akademy`, `confkdein` and `randa`. 

* Go to the Video add-on to view recorded video presentations
* Go to the Music add-on to view audio-only presentation recordings
    * Note that since `.ogg` files are currently considered audio files, some of the older video presentations in `.ogg` files are only shown in the Music library where they are played as audio (without showing the video).
